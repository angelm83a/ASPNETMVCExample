# ASPNETMVCExample
This is a responsive HTML CSS template that I modified to be implemented in Visual Studio. I split the pages in views and created 
the controllers. This project was intended for personal learning of ASP.Net MVC 5/C# and Visual Studio 2019 and as a portfolio.
It is not free from errors. I am still learning!

# Features
  - Responsive HTML template
  - ASP.Net MVC 5, C#
  - Contact form programmed (C#)

### License
You are free to use this project for personal learning, however, if you wish to use it and the template to publish a website, you can buy
the license from http://preview.themeforest.net/item/hamar-one-page-corporate-html-template/full_screen_preview/19407506?ref=freshdesignweb and reuse the code, or at least
to be a guide.
